# CodeUp: A Blind-First Python IDE

CodeUp is a Python IDE designed for blind and visually impaired learners. Unlike traditional IDEs that retrofit accessibility on top of visual workflows, CodeUp treats non-visual interaction as the default. Every core feature  navigation, execution, debugging, code understanding  works through audio, keyboard, and natural language commands.

The project is independently developed and intended for use in schools and accessibility programs.

## What it does

- **Voice commands** in English and Hindi for navigation, execution, and editing
- **Audio code structure** through sonification  pitch maps to indentation, distinct tones for functions, classes, loops, conditionals
- **Step-by-step execution traces** with spoken playback and a "story mode" narrative
- **Sandboxed Python execution** with subprocess isolation, restricted imports, time and memory caps, AST audit, and same-origin enforcement on state-changing requests
- **Optional AI assistance** (Groq Llama 3.3 70B) for error explanation, code generation, summarization, and a mentor mode with quizzes and bug challenges
- **Audio breakpoint debugger** with variable watching
- **Six-step interactive tutorial** in both English and Hindi covering print, variables, loops, and conditionals

AI assistance is strictly optional. Every core feature works without an API key or network connection.

## Accessibility

- Screen reader support via `aria-live` announcer (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Color vision modes (Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia)
- High Contrast mode
- Night Mode for low-light environments and users who prefer dark themes
- Dyslexia-friendly mode with Atkinson Hyperlegible font and increased line spacing
- Reduced motion support, both via in-app toggle and the OS-level `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Full keyboard navigation  every feature reachable without a mouse
- Press `Escape` at any time to stop speech mid-sentence
- No `window.prompt()`  all dialogs use accessible inline modals with focus management

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.8 or newer. The IDE itself runs offline once installed  Monaco, JetBrains Mono, and Atkinson Hyperlegible are all vendored. The landing page additionally requires a one-time Node build to vendor React and bundle the JSX components (see "Building the landing page" below).

Clone and set up a virtualenv:

    git clone https://github.com/da-taki/Code_Up.git
    cd Code_Up
    python -m venv .venv

Activate the virtualenv (Windows PowerShell):

    .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Activate the virtualenv (macOS / Linux):

    source .venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure environment:

    cp .env.example .env

Edit `.env` and set at minimum:

    FLASK_SECRET_KEY=<a random secret>
    GROQ_API_KEY=<your free key from https://console.groq.com>

If you don't set a Groq key, AI features return a clear spoken message rather than crashing. To disable AI entirely, set `GEMINI_ENABLED=0`.

### Optional: Offline AI via Ollama

CodeUp can fall back to a locally-running Ollama instance when Groq is unavailable (no internet, no API key, rate-limited). To enable:

1. Install Ollama from <https://ollama.com>
2. Pull a small model: `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`
3. Set environment variables in `.env`:

       OLLAMA_ENABLED=1
       OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
       OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b

When enabled, Groq is tried first; on any failure (network, auth, rate-limit), CodeUp transparently routes to Ollama and prefixes responses with `[offline mode]` so the user knows.

Run the application:

    python app.py

Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in Chrome or Edge. (Firefox does not support the Web Speech API for voice input  keyboard and the typed command box still work in any browser.)

Run tests:

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    python -m pytest -q

Tests are fully isolated  snippet storage redirects to a temp directory and no real AI calls are made.

## Building the landing page

The IDE at `/ide` works without any Node tooling. The marketing landing page at `/` uses React components that need to be bundled.

First-time setup:

    npm install
    npm run build

This produces:

- `static/vendor/react/react.production.min.js`
- `static/vendor/react/react-dom.production.min.js`
- `static/landing/dist/bundle.js`

After editing any `static/landing/*.jsx` file, rerun `npm run build`. Node is only required for the landing page  running, deploying, or hacking on the IDE never needs it.

If you're deploying to a school environment without Node, the three built files above can be committed to the repo so end users skip the build step entirely.

## Architecture

### Backend (`app.py`)

Flask application handling code execution, AST-based analysis, voice intent parsing, and AI proxying. Each `/run` request spawns a fresh subprocess confined to a per-session workspace directory, with restricted built-ins and (on POSIX systems) `RLIMIT_AS` and `RLIMIT_CPU` enforced via `preexec_fn`. Per-session state  execution traces, snippets, sandboxes  is keyed by signed session cookies.

### Frontend

Monaco Editor (vendored locally  no CDN dependency), JavaScript using the Web Speech API for voice recognition and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance` for output, Web Audio API for sonification. Speech recognition language switches automatically between `en-US` and `hi-IN` based on the selected interface language.

### Supporting modules

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `intent_parser.py` | Natural language to structured intent and slots, with Hindi number support |
| `structure_parser.py` | AST-based code structure extraction (functions, classes, loops, async detection, parent class tracking) |
| `sandboxed_fs.py` | Per-session restricted workspace file system |

## Voice Commands

A partial list. Many natural variations work  the intent parser is grammar-based, not exact-match.

| Say | Action |
|---|---|
| "run" / "execute code" | Run code |
| "go to line twenty five" | Navigate to line 25 |
| "read line three" | Read line 3 aloud |
| "what changed here" | Describe variable changes at current trace step |
| "next step" / "previous step" | Step through execution trace |
| "find variable x" | Jump to all usages of variable x |
| "summarize this file" | AI file summary |
| "generate code for fibonacci sequence" | AI code generation |
| "check for errors" | Syntax check plus audio beacon |
| "sonify block" | Hear current block as audio tones |
| "save snippet named hello world" | Save current code |
| "tell the story" | Narrate what your code did |
| "set breakpoint at line 10" | Audio debugger |
| "watch variable x" | Report x at each breakpoint |
| "continue" | Run to next breakpoint |
| "learning mode" | Start mentor / quiz mode |
| "quiz me on loops" | Get a quiz question |
| "explain variables" | Concept explanation |
| "bug challenge" | Find and fix a bug |
| "insert function called greet" | Voice code editing |
| "suggest next line" then "choose 2" | AI autocomplete |
| "help" | List all commands |

Hindi equivalents work for around 15 core commands including `चलाओ` (run), `कोड समझाओ` (analyze), `कोड ठीक करो` (fix), `लाइन बीस पर जाओ` (go to line 20), `मदद` (help). Hindi number words 0–50 are recognized in line-navigation commands.

## Sandbox

User code runs in a separate Python subprocess with:

- Restricted imports  only `math`, `random`, `string`, `datetime` allowed
- Restricted built-ins  `eval`, `exec`, `compile`, `open`, `__import__`, and direct module attribute access blocked
- 5-second wall-clock timeout
- 5,000-event trace cap to prevent runaway memory growth
- POSIX-only: 512 MB address space cap and 30-second CPU time cap via `setrlimit`
- Working directory confined to a per-session temp workspace
- `input()` blocked with a clear explanation suggesting hardcoded values

Per-session rate limit: 10 runs per 60 seconds.

## Status

v0.8.0  Deployment ready with full `input()` support, output diff narration, audio heartbeat, voice macros, output bookmarks, code structure breadcrumbs, beginner-mode error explanations, and a coffee-themed UI. Locally tested with the full test suite (200+ passing tests).

### What's new in 0.8.0

- **`input()` support, two ways**:
  - *Pre-flight* (default, reproducible): declare values ahead with the inputs panel, voice (`set inputs to alice and seventeen`), or a magic comment (`# inputs: alice, 17`)
  - *Live* (POSIX only): `say live input mode`, then your code pauses at each `input()` and asks you for the value via voice or typing
- **Output diff narration**: re-run code and hear only what changed, not the whole output again. Voice: `what's different`
- **Audio heartbeat**: soft tone every 500ms while code runs so you know it's alive
- **Voice macros**: `remember this as quick sort` saves the editor as a named macro; `use macro quick sort` loads it
- **Output bookmarks**: `bookmark this` mid-output, then `read from bookmark <name>` later
- **Breadcrumbs**: Alt+B (or `where am i`) reads "function calculate, inside for loop, line 15"
- **Beginner errors**: after an error, say `explain simply` for a jargon-free, real-life-analogy version
- **Auto-save**: every 30 seconds, silently. A draft from the previous session is restored automatically on next visit.
- **Coffee theme**: replaces the previous teal palette with cream, caramel, and espresso

Next:

- User testing with blind students
- Deployment behind HTTPS for non-localhost use
- Research write-up
